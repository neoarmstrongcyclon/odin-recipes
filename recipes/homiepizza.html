    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> Homie Pizza is a brilliantly created pizza made by my friends Matt and Jordan. It utilizes fresh pizza dough, fresh homegrown tomatoes
        among other delicious ingredients. The picture above is not a direct representation of what 
        homie pizza is nor is it what it looks like but I actually don't have a picture available so please bear with me.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Homegrown tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cheese (Matt and Jordan use a Mexican blend and some brie.)</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Artichokes</li>
        <li>Any other vegetables that you might want on your ZA.</li>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong><h4>Make your dough</h4></strong></p>
            <p>What you're gonna want to do is knead the hell out of that dough.
                Jordan and Matt use a kneader. But you're gonna knead the hell out of it and let it rest for a few hours to let it rise. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong><h4>Make your sauce</h4></strong></p>
            <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Farenheit. You're going to take your tomatoes, chop them in half and take off the stem on the top. You're going to chuck them into a food processor
                and blend it like there is no tomorrow. Throw in a little seasoning, a little ollie, and blend blend blend! 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong><h4>Flatten out your dough and add your toppings</h4></strong></p>
            <p>In a pan, place and press your dough until it is in a flat round circle. Add your sauce, spreading evenly over the pizza, save the edges. 
                Then sprinkle on the cheese and then any of the toppings that you had prepared for this pizza. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong><h4>Bake for 12-20 minutes until crust is golden brown</h4></strong></p>
